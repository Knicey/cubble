The term spatio-temporal data can incorporate various spatial and temporal characteristics and different data may require different data structures for wrangling and analysis. The spatio-temporal data that cubble addresses are those collected at unique fixed locations, allowing for irregularity in the temporal dimension, such as the weather station data. This corresponds to the full space-time and sparse space-time layouts in the spacetime paper [@spacetime]: 

```{r layout, echo = FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.retina=3}
library(tidyverse)
library(patchwork)
p1 <- tibble(
  id = 1:12,
  x = rep(1:4, each = 3),
  y = rep(1:3, 4)
) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(x) ,y = as.factor(y))) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_text(aes(y = y - 0.2, label = id)) + 
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1) + 
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("1st", "2nd", "3rd", "4th")) + 
  scale_y_discrete(labels = c("1st", "2nd", "3rd", "4th")) + 
  labs(x = "Time points", y = "Spatial features", title = "STF: full grid layout") 

p2 <- tibble(
  id = 1:7,
  x = c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4),
  y = c(1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2),
  label = c("1[1,1]", "2[1,2]", "3[1,3]", "4[2,2]", "5[3,2]", "6[1,3]", "7[2,4]")
) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(x) ,y = as.factor(y))) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_text(aes(y = y - 0.2, label = label)) + 
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1) + 
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("1st", "2nd", "3rd", "4th")) + 
  scale_y_discrete(labels = c("1st", "2nd", "3rd", "4th")) + 
  labs(x = "Time points", y = "Spatial features", title = "STS: sparse grid layout")

## Installation

You can install the released version of cubble from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("cubble")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("huizezhang-sherry/cubble")
```

## How cubble organises spatio-temporal data

Cubble organises spatio-temporal data in two structures: In a nested cubble (spatial cubble), spatial variables are organised as columns and temporal variables are nested within a specialised `ts` column: 

```{r echo = FALSE}
climate_mel
```

In a long cubble (temporal cubble), the temporal variables are expanded into the long form, while the spatial variables are stored as a data attribute: 

```{r echo = FALSE}
climate_mel %>% face_temporal()
```

The two forms can be pivoted back and forth with the pair of verb: `face_spatial()` and `face_temporal()`.

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/cubble-operations.png")
```


## Roadmap

  * To learn more about the cubble class: [1. The cubble class](articles/cb1class.html)
  * To create a cubble or coerce an existing R object into a cubble: [2. Creation and coercion](articles/cb2create.html)
  * To incoporate sf or tsibble in a cubble: [3. Compatibility with tsibble and sf](articles/cb3tsibblesf.html)
  * To create glyph map, match multiple data sources, and create interactive graphics with cubble: [4. Making a glyph map](articles/cb4glyph.html), [5. Matching different data sources](articles/cb5match.html), and [6. Interactive graphics](articles/cb6interactive.html)
