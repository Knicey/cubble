The term spatio-temporal data can incorporate various spatial and temporal characteristics and different data may require different data structures for wrangling and analysis. The spatio-temporal data that cubble addresses are those collected at unique fixed locations, allowing for irregularity in the temporal dimension, such as the weather station data. 

## Installation

You can install the released version of cubble from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("cubble")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("huizezhang-sherry/cubble")
```

## How cubble organises spatio-temporal data

Cubble organises spatio-temporal data in two structures: In a nested cubble (spatial cubble), spatial variables are organised as columns and temporal variables are nested within a specialised `ts` column: 

```{r echo = FALSE}
climate_mel
```

In a long cubble (temporal cubble), the temporal variables are expanded into the long form, while the spatial variables are stored as a data attribute: 

```{r echo = FALSE}
climate_mel %>% face_temporal()
```

The two forms can be pivoted back and forth with the pair of verb: `face_spatial()` and `face_temporal()`.

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/cubble-operations.png")
```


## Roadmap

  * To learn more about the cubble class: [1. The cubble class](https://huizezhang-sherry.github.io/cubble/articles/cb1class.html)
  * To create a cubble or coerce an existing R object into a cubble: [2. Creation and coercion](https://huizezhang-sherry.github.io/cubble/articles/cb2create.html)
  * To incorporate sf or tsibble in a cubble: [3. Compatibility with tsibble and sf](https://huizezhang-sherry.github.io/cubble/articles/cb3tsibblesf.html)
  * To create glyph map, match multiple data sources, and create interactive graphics with cubble: [4. Making a glyph map](https://huizezhang-sherry.github.io/cubble/articles/cb4glyph.html), [5. Matching different data sources](https://huizezhang-sherry.github.io/cubble/articles/cb5match.html), and [6. Interactive graphics](https://huizezhang-sherry.github.io/cubble/articles/cb6interactive.html)
