    A cubble object can be created from separate spatial and temporal component
    with `make_cubble()`. Coercion from `tbl_df`, `ncdf4`, `stars` and `sftime`
    objects is made available in `as_cubble()`.

    A cubble object allows you to wrangle spatio-temporal data through pivoting
    the data into its spatial and temporal component.

    The cubble class support on the following dplyr verbs: `mutate()`,
    `filter()`,  `arrange()`, `select()`, `group_by()`, `ungroup()`,
    `summarise()`. `rename()`, `bind_cols()` `rowwise()`,  `relocate()`,
    the slice family (`slice_head()`, `slice_tail()`, `slice_max()`,
    `slice_min()`, `slice_sample()`) and the join family (`left_join()`,
    `right_join()`, `inner_join()`, `full_join()`, `anti_join()`, `semi_join()`)

  desc: >
    You can promote the spatial component of a cubble object to also include
    the sf class with `make_spatial_sf()` (or create initially with an sf object
    in `make_cubble()`). The `sf` functionalities that work on the sf column
    carry over to a cubble object. Similarly, the temporal component of a cubble
    object can be updated to a tsibble object with `make_temporal_tsibble()`
    (or created originally with a tsibble object in `make_cubble()`).
    Functionalities applied to the tsibble class can then be applied to a temporal
    cubble object.
